## Draft Notes

1. We are a company of owners. Owners take results personally.
Every company hopes that their employees embody their organizational values and embrace the culture as their own. This is the only way to realize cultural advantages and sustain the performance benefits from increased employee engagement. 

However, for employees to grasp the culture, they'll first need to develop an owner's mindset. I've seen companies speed up the process by rallying employees around a shared vision and giving them autonomy over their roles.

2. Living Organizations

3. Leadership by personal example is at the core of our culture. We do what we say.
Nothing will undermine a culture faster than those who don't practice what they preach -- especially at the leadership level. 

A list of core principles will only be worth the paper that they're printed on unless leaders take it upon themselves to be an example for others.
