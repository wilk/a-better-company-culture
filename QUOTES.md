##From [Why you should be optimizing](https://99u.adobe.com/articles/6990/why-you-should-be-optimizing)

> Despite research that encourages us to build on our strengths, we spend more time fixing what's broken than optimizing what works. Why? Because any measure of success impairs our ability to imagine something better. I call this the “horizon of success” effect, because it's hard to see the potential that lies beyond something that works.

> The old adage "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" cripples us when it comes to optimizing what works.

> Optimization isn't about making drastic changes. Introducing too many risk factors into a successful project or system IS dangerous. The key to optimization is making incremental tweaks in a controlled and measurable way.

* Seek forms of measurement
* Introduce only one change at a time
* Don't assume that just because something works it can't be better
